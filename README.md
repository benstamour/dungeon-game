The Dungeon
===========

This project is a 3D dungeon platformer made in Unity and my first game creation since graduating university. In this game, the player must navigate a series of deadly obstacles in order to get to the end, with the optional additional challenge of collecting each of the ten coloured orbs placed along the player's route. The goal is to make it to the end as fast as possible!

I designed and created the dungeon arena using assets from the Unity Asset Store, and I also worked with scripting, GUI, animations, textures, audio, and editing 3D models. To play the game, you can download the .zip file for the build using **[this link](https://drive.google.com/uc?export=download&id=1cXAi-hRXKFhs0zXE1E66n1rcKV8ldCo2)** and run `The Dungeon.exe`. You can also check out **[this page](https://bensta.epizy.com/dungeon/)** to see some images of the game along with a list of assets used in the final build and links to the sources.
