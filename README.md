The Dungeon
===========

This project is a 3D dungeon platformer made in Unity and my first game creation since my university projects. In this game, the player must navigate a series of deadly obstacles in order to get to the end, with the optional additional challenge of collecting each of the ten blue orbs placed along the player's route. The goal is to make it to the end as fast as possible!

I designed and created the dungeon arena using assets from the Unity Asset Store, and I also worked with scripting, GUI, and animations. To play the game, you can download the .zip file for the build using **[this link](https://drive.google.com/uc?export=download&id=1CqePXpX5vNQ1Zkiv-qVr-z6x1cGani6S)** and run `The Dungeon.exe`. You can also check out **[this page](https://bensta.epizy.com/dungeon/)** to see some preview images along with a list of assets used in the final game and links to the sources.
